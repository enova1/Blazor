# Blazor Application

This is a Blazor application built with .NET 8, C#, and Razor Pages. It consumes the Web API project and interacts with it to provide dynamic content to the users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or any other preferred code editor

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Blazor application:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://git@github.com:enova1/Blazor.git
   ```

2. **Open the Solution in Visual Studio**:
   - Open Visual Studio.
   - Navigate to File > Open > Project/Solution.
   - Select the `.sln` file from the cloned repository.

3. **Build the Solution**:
   - Once the solution is loaded, build the solution to restore dependencies:
     ```
     Ctrl + Shift + B
     ```

4. **Run the Blazor Application**:
   - Set the Blazor application project as the startup project.
   - Press `F5` or click on the Start Debugging button to run the Blazor application.

5. **Explore the Blazor Application**:
   - Once the application is running, you can navigate through the different pages and components to interact with the content fetched from the Web API.

## Consuming the Web API

- The Blazor application consumes my Web API project (https://github.com/enova1/WebApi) to fetch data and interact with the backend services.
- Ensure that the Web API project is running and accessible before using the Blazor application.
